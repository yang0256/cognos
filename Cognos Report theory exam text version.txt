Bursting a report allows distribution of its contents to various recipients. Bursting is the process of running a report once, and then dividing the results for users who each view a subset of the data. For example, salespeople in different regions need a report that shows the sales target for their country or region. You use the bursting feature to send each salesperson only the information they need. You can distribute burst reports by email or save them to a folder for viewing in the IBM Cognos Analytics portal. You can learn more about bursting reports in the IBM Cognos Analytics: Author Reports Advanced (V11.1.x) course. 
Share and Embed buttons are available for content items such as reports. These buttons create URLs that open content items directly in a web browser or embed the content items in a custom web page. 
You can create custom URLs that open or run IBM Cognos Analytics content. This feature extends the sharing and embedding feature by giving you more control over how the content objects are opened or run. 
Interactive filtering 
Report consumers can create filters directly on the report output to better understand the report context, and modify views without needing a report author to make the changes. 
In the application toolbar of the interactive viewer, a filter icon is available that opens the filter panel. This panel shows all the filters that the report consumer created in the report output. When a data container is selected, filters that apply to the selected data container are highlighted. Report consumers can edit or delete filters directly within the panel. 
Report consumers can resize the filter panel and pin or unpin the panel, depending on the screen resolution.  
Report authors can make a filter visible to report consumers so that they can interact with it by using the interactive filter panel. 
Working with reports 
IBM Cognos Analytics includes report templates and color themes to choose when creating a report. The templates and themes are stored in the Templates.zip deployment file. After the file is deployed, the templates and themes are located in the Templates folder in Team content. 
You can create your own report templates and themes, and make them available to other users. Save the templates in the Templates folder in Team content, and save themes in the Style Reference Reports folder in the Templates folder. When you create a new report, any report or theme that is saved in the Templates folder appears in the list of templates or themes. 
To convert a report to a template click Save > Convert to Template on the Application bar. 
You can open an existing report, make changes and then save or save as a new report with a new name. To access existing reports, browse to them in either Team content or My content. To edit them, click the More icon (vertical ellipsis to the right of the report name). 
As part of the report creation process, you can: 
• Choose from a selection of templates. 
• Choose from a selection of data containers for presenting your report, such as list, crosstab, or visualization. You can include a combination of data containers in a single report. 
• Add metadata items from a package or a data module to the data containers by using the Source tab of the Data pane. Data items can be added from one or more packages in the same report and be accessed from a data module. Data items from a package and a data module cannot be combined in the same report. 
• Add data items into your report that exist in your query, by using the Data Items tab under Insertable objects. 
• Add various report objects into your report, such as Block, Text item, Table, Prompt, and HTML item, by using the Toolbox tab. 
• Use the navigation menu to browse to individual report and prompt pages by using the Pages folder. 
• Use the navigation menu browse to the queries that make up the report, by using the Queries folder. 
• Modify report objects and data item properties by using the Properties pane. 
• Work in different authoring modes. 
• Author by using the metadata items from the report, such as column or row labels, in Page design mode. 
Country 
Revenue 
<Country> 
<Revenue> 
• Author by using the actual data values in the report, in Page preview mode.

$34, 675, 662.43 
• Interactively view query and rendering performance on report objects in a report by enabling the included performance details option in the run options for the report. 

Activity: Create a simple list report 

Create a list report that includes attribute and measure data items. The attribute data items need to be sorted by the measure values in descending order, and the measure values need to be displayed with a meaningful format. For example, revenue values can be formatted as currency. 
In this activity, you will: 
• Create a report template. 
• Add a data source. 
• Add data to the list. 
• View the data items in the query. 
• Remove a column. 
• Format and sort the data. 
Choose a report template. 
You should use Internet Explorer for all the Activities in this course.  
• In Windows, click Start > Internet Explorer. 
• If you are prompted to Set up Internet Explorer 11, click Use recommended security and compatibility settings, and then click OK.

• From the Insertable objects pane, expand Sales and Marketing (query) > 
Sales (query) > Employee by region query subject . 
• Double-click the Country query item to add it to the list report object. 
The list report object now has one column. 
• Double-click City to add it to the list report object. 
City is automatically added to the end of the list. 
• On the Insertable objects pane, right-click Last name, and then click Properties. 
The Properties dialog box appears, with details about the item. 
• Click Close.  
• Right-click City, and then click Lineage. 
Lineage information traces the metadata of a data item back through the package and the data sources that are used by the package. Lineage displays any data item filters that the data modeler added or defined in the data model. Viewing lineage information ensures that you add the correct data items to a report. For example, you can view the lineage information of a model calculation to see how it was created. 
Lineage for data items can also be viewed in the interactive viewer after running a report. To do this you would click the data item, and then from the on-demand toolbar, click Explore, and then click Lineage, noting that this can only be done in a saved report. 
• Click the X at the upper right of the window to close it. 
• Click First name, and then Ctrl+click Last name, Employee level and Position name.

• From Insertable objects, expand the Sales fact query subject, and then drag Revenue to add it to the end of the list (you should see a flashing black bar inside of a white bar, indicating the correct drop zone). 

If you place the data item outside of the list, a message opens stating that IBM Cognos Analytics - Reporting created a singleton. You want the new data item to be added to the end of the list. If a singleton is created, undo your last action, and then redo the previous step. 
You would now like to modify the order of the columns. 
• From the Application bar, click Show properties . 
• In the work area, click the data for Last name (not the header) to select the column body, then drag it to the left of the First name list column body. 
Make sure that the column body is selected by clicking any one of the cells in the column, not the column header. To check to see what element of the report is selected, check the title bar of the Properties pane. 
A flashing black bar appears when the item is over a drop zone. A section of the results appear as follows: 

You will now view the data items in the query. 
View the data items in the query. 
• From the Insertable objects pane, click Data items , and then click Query1.

The column is removed from the list. 
• From the navigation menu, click Report > Queries > Query1. 
The Employee level data item that you cut still appears in the Data Items pane. Although you removed it from the report layout in the Pages view, the data item is not removed from the query. Keeping the data item in the query can be useful for tasks such as creating a calculation. Examples of where you would keep a data item in the query, but remove it from the report layout include: creating an expression based on the data item, sorting, or formatting data in the list by using the data item. 
• From the navigation menu, click Report > Pages > Page1 to return to the work area. 
• From the Application bar, click Undo . 
The Employee level column is added back to the list. 
• Ensure that the Employee level column is still selected, and then from the on-demand toolbar click Delete .

Dimensionally modeled relational data 
Dimensionally modeled relational metadata is data that is taken from a relational source and modeled as a star schema. Hierarchies are applied to allow for drill behavior. 
Dimensionally modeled relational data extends dimensional capabilities (such as drilldown) to relational sources. 
With dimensional analysis, your corporate data is organized in the way you think about your business so that you spend more time on analysis, rather than on data retrieval. 
Only dimensional models allow drill up and drill down behavior in analyses and reports. 

Activity: Use a dimensionally modeled relational data source 

Most of the reports in this course use relational data sources. However this activity demonstrates how to create a report with a dimensional data source. It provides an overall view of the types of data sources that can be accessed in IBM Cognos Analytics. 
Explore a dimensionally modeled relational data source and create a report that enables navigation to a lower level of detail. 
In this activity, you will: 
• Create a blank report. 
• Examine the data source. 
• Add data items to the list. 
• Drill up and drill down. 
Create a blank report. 
• Ensure you are logged into IBM Cognos Analytics (http://localhost:9300/bi) as Frank Bretton (brettonf/Education1). 
• From the Side bar, click New, and then click Report. 
• Select a Blank template, and then click OK.

Team content/Samples/Models/GO data warehouse (analysis), and then click Open. 
The Sources tab on the left displays the folders available in the package.  
• On the Sources tab, click Options . 
A set of actions specific to working with a dimensional data source are available. 
• Click Options again to close the menu. 
• In the center of the work area, click Add , click List, and then click OK to accept the default options in the Object and query name dialog box. 
• On the Sources tab, expand Sales and Marketing (analysis). 
The folders in the Sales and Marketing (analysis) folder appear. 

Sales folder. 
 and regular dimensions  are displayed 
in the data tree. The presence of these objects indicates that you are working with a dimensional data source. 
Examine the data source. 
• Expand the Sales fact measures query subject. 
Review the measures  available in the Sales fact measures query. 

This hierarchy contains a Members folder and five levels. 
Region level. 
The Members folder and the Region code query item  appear in the data tree. 
• Under Region, expand the Members folder (under Region) to see the five sales regions. 

The member values are displayed within the Members folder. 
Add data items to the list. 
Before adding data items to the list, you want to ensure that summary rows do not automatically appear in the report. 
• Under Sources, expand the Time dimension, Time hierarchy, Year level, and Members folder. 
• Drag 2011 to the list report object in the work area that displays Drop items here to create new columns. 
Notice how you can add specific members to a report, instead of adding all years first, and then filtering to include only the desired years, as is done in relational data sources. 
• Under the Retailers dimension, Retailers hierarchy, Region level, Members folder, expand the Americas member, and then drag the Canada member to the end of the list report object, dropping when the flashing black bar appears. 
That area of the report object indicated by the flashing black bar is known as the drop zone. 
          Products dimension, Products hierarchy, Product line level, Members folder, Camping Equipment member, Tents member, and then drag Star Dome to the drop zone of the list report object. 
• Ensure Sales fact measures is expanded, and then drag the Quantity measure to the list report object. 

The member and measure data items are displayed in the list. 
Drill up and drill down. 
Because the report contains dimensionally modeled relational data, you can drill down to a greater level of detail than in a relational model. 
• From the Application bar, click Run options, and then click Run HTML. 
 
You navigated to a lower level of detail and displayed data for each quarter of 2011. In the 2011 column of data, you can click one of the values (for example, Q3 2011), click Explore, and then click Drill Up to drill back up if you want. 

Close the rendered New report tab. 
• From the Application bar, expand the Switcher menu list. 
• Beside New report, click Remove, and then click Close without saving. 
• Leave IBM Cognos Analytics open for the next activity. 

Use personal data sources and data modules 
Upload personal data 
In IBM Cognos Analytics, personal data sources like a CSV or XLS file, can be imported into IBM Cognos. The personal data source can then be converted to a data module, after which it can be used as a data source for a report. 
The process begins with the Upload files feature that is available from the New button on the Welcome page. The uploaded personal data source must be contained as a data module. This process is accomplished by selecting New > Data module. Data can be dragged from the Selected sources pane to the Data module pane to define the data module. Once the data module is been defined, it can be renamed and saved, making it available as a data source for report creation. 
Upload custom images 
Using the Image Library extension, you can upload custom images directly into your report without the need to navigate to the file location. This function is generally thought of as an administrative function. 
Using navigation paths in a data module 
View navigation paths on the Data items tab of a data module. This option allows browsing to any level that is defined in the data module. 
To use this feature, click a data item that has one or more navigation paths that are defined. The on-demand toolbar shows the navigation icon, which allows users to go to another level, or even to skip to a different navigation path if using dimensional data. 
Activity: Use a personal data source

• Leave IBM Cognos Analytics open for the next activity. 
Examine list reports 
Use a list data container to create a list report. List reports let you present tabular information and show detailed data from your database. 
Group data 
Group on one or more columns to organize how the data is viewed in the list. 
The list should preferably follow a 1:n cardinality from left to right in order to properly display the grouping. 
Spanning one group of items by a second group can be helpful if the second group contains many items. 
You can level span grouped items only by other grouped items on the report. 
To group related information together, select a column and click Group/Ungroup on the toolbar. For example, when country and city are both grouped, you can choose to show the country name each time that the country changes (span Country by Country), each time the city changes (span Country by City), or every time a new record (no level spanning) is introduced. 
A grouped item appears at the top of a new page regardless of level spanning. For example, when Country is spanned by City, the Country name appears at the top of the next page, even for records in the same City. 
Grouping a column in a list generates an order by clause in the generated SQL, so your data is returned grouped and automatically sorted ascending. 
Format columns 
You can format list columns at different levels based on your requirements: 
• Lowest level: format the cells on a list column 
• Higher level: format both cells and the title in a list column 
• Highest level: format both the cells and titles in all columns in the list 
Include headers and footers 
Headers and footers can be placed: 
• at the top or bottom of a list on each page 
• at the top of the first page or bottom of the last page 
• before or after a group of details 
Choose where to place headers and footers based on your requirements.

The affected portion of the Groups pane appears as follows: 

The Product line column will now be sorted in ascending order based on the revenue generated by each product line. The product line that generated the least revenue will appear at the beginning of the report. 
Click OK, and then from the Application bar, run the report in HTML. 

In the example above, the report displays Quantity and Revenue for each Retailer type, for each Product, Product type, and Product line. Because you sorted the Revenue column in descending order, Retailers with the highest revenue appear first. Because you sorted Product line by Revenue in ascending order, the Product line with the lowest revenue (in this case Outdoor Protection) appears first in the list.

Aggregate fact data 
You can aggregate fact data to show trends or summaries. 

This example shows revenue for each product line for each employee, as well as the total for all product lines for each employee. Depending on the type of measure that is used in your report, you can also show minimum, maximum, average, total, count, or calculated data. 
In Framework Manager, used to create data models for Cognos Analytics - Reporting, default data item properties can be set. Two of these properties are Rollup Aggregate function and Aggregate function. 
Rollup Aggregate Function specifies the type of aggregation to apply to summary values. These values appear at the higher levels of lists and crosstabs. The default setting is Automatic. The setting of Automatic indicates that the aggregation that is applied is based on the data type of the query item. Therefore, an integer data type with Rollup Aggregate set to automatic provides total aggregation. In the example, the Rollup Aggregate function is set to Total on the Revenue data item. 
The Aggregate function specifies the type of aggregation to apply to individual values that appear as detail rows in lists or crosstabs. 
Identify differences in aggregation 
Data items that are selected from the source tab are calculated and summarized before aggregation. Data items that are selected from the Data Items tab will be calculated and summarized after aggregation. 
Fact data items should be selected from the Data items tab if they are to be used multiple times in a report or calculation, since they would not be re-aggregated based on the entire query. This process prevents any double counting of the fact data item and provides predictable results. 
Activity: Explore data aggregation 

Create a report that compares key performance indicators across different data items. This report should display values for individual totals and averages. Examine the underlying query model at various stages. 
In this activity, you will: 
• Examine the query model. 
• View individual records. 
• Group the query items. 
Examine the query model. 
• Ensure you are logged into IBM Cognos Analytics as Frank Bretton (brettonf/Education1). 
• Create a new report that uses the Blank template, a List data container, and the data source Team content/Samples/Models/GO data warehouse (query). 
• Expand Sales and Marketing (query) and Sales (query) and then add the following query items to the new List template: 
• Products: Product line 
• Order method: Order method type 
• Sales fact: Revenue 
• From the navigational menu at the top , click Report > Queries > Query1. 
The three data items in the Data Items pane each correspond to an item in a column in the list. 
• In the Data Items pane, click Revenue, and then from the Application bar, click Show properties (if the properties pane is not already visible for Revenue). 
The Properties pane shows that the Detail aggregation property is set to Total. Data in the query is grouped and summarized at the lowest level of detail, by calculating the total revenue generated at that level. In the report, the lowest level of detail is the last attribute item before the measure data item was added. 
Run the report in HTML. 

The report shows the revenue that is generated by each order method for each product line. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
View individual records. 
You want to review the individual records that make up the summary level totals. To achieve this result, set the Auto Group & Summarize property for this query to No. 
• In the navigation menu, click Query1 > Query 1. 
 
• From the Properties pane, under DATA, click the Auto group & summarize property, and then in the list, click No. 

The report no longer displays a single row for the totals. In this example, the report shows rows containing the individual measure values that make up the summary totals that were previously displayed. 

Close the rendered New report tab. 
• Set the Auto group & summarize property for Query1 back to Yes. 
Group the query items. 
You want to group the data at the highest level and add aggregate data to display an average. 
• From the navigation menu, click Report > Pages > Page1. 
• In the List, click the Revenue column body, and then from the on-demand toolbar, 
Data format .  
Hint: You may have to close the Properties pane in order to see the Data format icon. 
• In the Format type list, click Currency. 
• Under Properties, click Currency, in the list, select USD - United States of America, dollar, and then click OK. 
• In the List, click the Product line column body (this is the highest level attribute type data item), and then from the on-demand toolbar, click Group / Ungroup. 
• In the List, click the Revenue column body. 
• From the on-demand toolbar, click Summarize, and then click Average. 
Examine how the specified aggregation changed the Summary property for the measure type data item in this query. 
• From the navigation menu, click Report > Queries > Query1. 
• In the Data Items pane, click Average(Revenue), and then if necessary, on the Application bar, click Show properties. 
The Properties pane shows that the Summary property is now set to Average. The specified measure for grouped items in the report is aggregated to display the average. 
Run the report in HTML. 

In this example, the data is grouped by the Product line (highest level data item). For each Camping Equipment value at this level, there is a displayed aggregate row showing the average value of all values for the Order method type. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• On the Application bar, expand the Switcher menu list and remove the New report without saving. 
• Leave IBM Cognos Analytics open for the next activity. 
Multiple facts and repeated information 
Use shared dimensions to create multi-fact queries 
When authoring reports with multiple facts across the business, it is necessary to use at least one shared dimension item to ensure correlated and predictable results. 
A shared dimension is created by the data modeler to provide consistent results throughout the company's different business units. When business units report with these shared query items, they communicate more efficiently as a whole by providing the same base of information. 
Shared dimensions are also known as conformed dimensions. 
Results of multiple-fact queries can vary if the level of granularity differs and you use a non-conformed dimension. For example, in a package that contains a Time dimension, the granularity for time would differ between Sales target and Revenue. Sales targets could be recorded monthly, whereas, the Revenue could be recorded daily. This is not an issue when reporting and will not cause confusing results if you report at a common level of granularity, such as in this case, the month level. If you report at the day level, inventory levels display repeating values, the month total for every day of the month in the report. These values will not be double-counted. 
Present repeated information 
You can use either repeaters or repeater tables to present repeated information. 
Use repeaters to duplicate individual item(s) across a single row without a particular structure. 
Use repeater tables to repeat items in a table structure, such as mailing label information. 

Activity: Create a multi-fact query 

Create a list report that includes measure type data items that have values at different levels of granularity, and a non-conformed dimension. Identify how the multi-fact query, with a non-conformed dimension, returns unexpected results (repeating values). Replace the non-conformed dimension with a conformed dimension, and identify how results become accurate (no repeating values). 
In this activity, you will: 
• Add two facts from different query subjects. 
• Add context. 
• Add a query item from a conformed dimension. 
• Delete a data item. 
Add two facts from different query subjects. 
• Ensure you are logged into IBM Cognos Analytics as Frank Bretton (brettonf/Education1). 
• Create a report with the Blank template, List data container, using the relational data source Team content/Samples/Models/GO data warehouse (query). 
• From the Sales and Marketing (query) folder, add the following items to the list: 
• Sales (query)/Sales fact: Revenue 
• Sales target (query)/Sales target fact: Sales target • 	Run the report in HTML. 
 
In this example, these are two distinct aggregated totals, and were returned as a result of two separate Select statements. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
Add context. 
You want to include an attribute type data item to give context and meaning to the measure type data items. For example, if the report contained Revenue and Sales target, you could add the year in which the orders closed as a point in time to compare Revenue to Sales target. 
• From the Sales (query) namespace, add the following query item to the beginning of the report: 
• Time (close day): Year (close date) 

The Revenue values change with each year, but the Sales target values do not. This is because the Time (close day) is not a conformed dimension. This dimension is not shared by both the two facts: Sales fact and Sales target. The Sales target fact has no relationship to Time (close day). 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
Add a query item from a conformed dimension. 
You will add a shared dimension to the report. This dimension will have a relationship to both Revenue and Sales target. 
• Examine the time-related query subjects under Sales (query) and Sales target (query). 
The Time (close day) query subject exists in the Sales (query) namespace, but not in the Sales target (query) namespace. This tells you that Time (close day) is not shared across the facts, and therefore is not a shared dimension.  
The Time query subject exists in both the Sales (query) and Sales target (query) namespaces; therefore, it is a shared dimension. 
• Under Sales (query), expand Time, and then drag Year to the beginning of the list. 

The Sales target numbers now change from year to year. In 2010, there was 
7,060,666.21 worth of orders that were placed in that year, but did not close until 2011. The orders that were placed in 2010 and closed in that same year totaled 907,292,137.51. Because Sales target has no relationship to the non-conformed dimension, Year (close date), it just repeats the value it knows for 2010. This is an example of the inaccurate results that can occur when using non-conformed query items with multi-fact reports. Therefore, it is best to use conformed query items. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
Delete a data item. 
Delete the data item that represents the non-conformed dimension from the list. 
• In the List, click the Year (close date) list column body, and then from the ondemand toolbar, click Delete . 

The values for the measure type data items now make sense and there are no repeating values. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• On the Application bar, expand the Switcher menu list, and then remove the New report without saving. 
• Leave IBM Cognos Analytics open for the next activity. 
Activity: Create a mailing list report 

Create a mailing list report that uses location information. Your data source must include location data such as Region, Country, City, Address, Province or State. Address information must be listed alphabetically by country with the country name appearing at the top. For easy readability, each page must contain no more than three addresses across and four down. 
In this activity, you will: 
• Create a repeater table. 
• Add items to the table. 
• Sort data items apply style. 
• Change the frequency and positioning of the tables. 
Create a repeater table. 
• Ensure you are logged into IBM Cognos Analytics as Frank Bretton (brettonf/Education1). 
• Create a new report that uses the Blank template, and the Team content/Samples/Models/GO data warehouse (query) package. 
• Under Insertable objects, click the Toolbox tab , and then expand DATA CONTAINER. 
• Drag a Repeater table object to the report, and then click OK to accept the default options. 
• In the Toolbox pane, drag a Table object to the drop zone in the Repeater table object, in the report. 
• In the Insert table dialog box, change the number of columns to 1, the number of rows to 7, and then click OK. 
The work area now contains a two-column, three-row repeater table containing six tables, each having one column and seven rows. 
Add items to the table. 
• Under Insertable objects, click Sources . 
• From the navigation menu, click Report > Queries > Query1. 
• From the Sources tab, expand Sales and Marketing (query) > Sales (query). 
• Expand Employee by region, and then drag Country to the Data Items pane. 
• One at a time, drag Address 1, Address 2, City, Province or State, Postal zone, and again, Country into the Data Items pane. 

When you add multiple instances of the same query item, subsequent items will be numbered to show that it is a duplicate entry. Then they can be treated as two separate data items. In the example above, the Country query item has been added twice. The first instance appears as Country, while the second instance appears as Country1. 
• From the navigation menu, click Report > Pages > Page1. 
• Under Insertable objects, click Data items . 
• From the Data items pane, drag Country into the first cell of the first 1x7 table. The value is repeated in the other 5 tables. 
• Drag Address 1, Address 2, City, Province or State, Postal zone, and again Country2 into the remaining table cells. A portion of the results appear as follows; 

Notice that there are six identical tables. 
Sort data items and apply style. 
• Click the <Country> data item at the top of one of the tables, ensuring you select only the item and not the entire cell. 
You can use the Properties pane to verify that only a Text item is selected, and not a Table cell. 
 
All of the <Country> data items at the top of each table are selected. 
• From the on-demand toolbar, click Sort, and then click Ascending. 
A Sort Ascending icon appears beside the data item that represents country in the first table. 
 
• From the on-demand toolbar, click Font, and then in the Size list, click 12 pt. 
• In the Weight list, click Bold, and then click OK. 
Change the frequency and positioning of the tables. 
• In the upper left corner of the Repeater table, click the container selector to select the entire container. 
• From the Application bar, click Show properties, if necessary. 
• In the Properties pane, under GENERAL, change value for the Across property to 3, change the value of the down property to 4, and then press Enter. 
• In the Properties pane, under POSITIONING, double-click Table properties, select the Fixed size check box, and then click OK. 
• In the upper left corner of the first table, click the container selector to select all of the tables. 
You should only see the individual tables selected, not the Repeater table. 
• In the Properties pane, under BOX, double-click Margin. 
• In the Right margin and Top margin boxes, type 10, and then click OK. 
This adds the appropriate space for the printed labels. 
• From the Application toolbar, click Run options, and then click Run PDF. 

The report is displayed in PDF format. PDF would be the appropriate run output for mailing labels. Notice that the sort is in ascending order within each column of tables. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• On the Application bar, expand the Switcher menu list, and then remove the New report without saving. 
• Leave IBM Cognos Analytics open for the next activity. 
Create crosstab reports 
A crosstab report is a tabular display of data with data items appearing on rows and columns, and is useful for analyzing and comparing summary data. 
Use a crosstab data container to add data items to rows and columns, and measures to the body of the crosstab. 

This image shows the location of data items and measures in a crosstab format. 
Crosstab edge cells have four drop zones: one on each side, one at the top of the cell, and one at the bottom of the cell. Use the crosstab drop zones to add items as parents, peers, or children of other items in the crosstab. Using crosstab drop zones, you can quickly create crosstabs using drag-and-drop functionality. 
Add measures to a crosstab 
Any data item that can be aggregated can be added to the crosstab as the measure. 
The measure defines the data in the report, such as revenue, quantity, or profit margin. 
You can add measures to the body of the report or to either the row or column edges. A measure added to the body of the report is known as the default measure. It is used in cells where the measure is not defined on the row or column edge. 
Regardless of where a measure is added, the crosstab fact cells contain the measure values. 
In crosstabs, you can show values as a percentage of a summary instead of the actual values. For example, you can show the revenue that was generated by each product line as a percentage of the total revenue. 
Data sources for a crosstab 
Relational models have a basic metadata structure that looks like tables and columns in a database. 
Dimensionally Modeled Relational (DMR) models are built from relational data sources, but are modeled with a dimensional structure (like OLAP) consisting of measures and dimensions. 
Because crosstabs use rows and columns to define the basic structure and determine cell values, they are better suited to dimensional reporting. 
Best practices to keep in mind when using crosstab reporting objects include the following: 
• Crosstabs are, by design, a dimensional reporting object. 
• Insert the data items you wish to view in the rows and columns to focus the report, rather than using filters. 
• Filters in a crosstab may cause unpredictable results and should be used only when necessary. 
• Crosstabs can be used in relational data reporting, but take care to maintain predictable results. 

Activity: Create a simple crosstab report

Create complex crosstab reports 
Crosstab drop zones let you create a wide variety of crosstab layouts to meet your business requirements. 
Add items as peers 
To add a second item as a peer below an existing item, drop the new item below the bottom instance of the item on the row edge. To add a second item as a peer above the existing item, drop the new item above either instance of the item on the row edge. 
To add a second item as a peer to the right of the existing item, drop the new item to the right of the far right instance of the item on the column edge. To add a second item as a peer to the left of the existing item, drop the new item to the left of either instance of the item on the column edge. 
Create crosstab nodes and crosstab members 
The row and column edges of a crosstab are composed of sets of crosstab nodes. A crosstab node contains one crosstab node member, as well as any crosstab node members nested under it. 
Each crosstab node member refers to a data item. 
Crosstab nodes and crosstab node members let you easily create and modify complex crosstabs.

Create visualization reports 
Data can be displayed graphically to effectively show comparisons, relationships, and trends using one or more of the available visualization types. IBM Cognos Analytics - Reporting provides many rich, visually appealing visualizations with additional options to enhance them. 
Visualization categories 
Authors can choose from the following: 
• 11.1 visualizations 
• 11.0 visualizations 
• Legacy visualizations 
• Charts 
11.1, 11.0, and Charts categories of visualizations are included with the installation of IBM Cognos Analytics. The Legacy visualizations can be imported into the Visualization library through the IBM_Cognos_Samples.zip deployment archive. As well, additional visualizations can be authored, or existing ones can be modified, and then imported into the Visualization library. 
The 11.1 visualizations category is the default for this version of the product. 
The four categories of visualizations, have different visualization types, each of which emphasize different things. To choose a type, consider what you want the chart to illustrate. For example, if you want to show contributions of parts to a whole, then you would choose a Pie type visualization. If you want to emphasize the magnitude of change over time, then you would choose an Area type visualization. 
The features and benefits of each visualization type are displayed to the right of the Visualization gallery dialog box when you click the visualization type. 
Customize visualizations 
As described, different categories of visualizations will have different properties available for modification. 
Some properties are common to all types. For example, color schemes, rescaling of axes numbers, renaming axes, and displaying details can enhance reports. Fills and Background customization can greatly enhance the visual appeal of charts. Tool tips are available by default, and provide additional information while adding a level of interaction to the visualization. 
As a report, dashboard, or story author, you can create custom color palettes while you work on the canvas. You can create two types of custom palettes: 
• Categorical palettes are used for visualizations that support discrete colors, like pie or bar charts. 
• Continuous palettes are used for visualizations that support color transitions, like a map or a heat map. 
Visualizations use percentage size, so they resize based on-screen resolution. 
See the Cognos Analytics Reporting documentation for more information on how to create custom color palettes. 
Client side visualizations 
All 11.1 visualizations have client-side rendering capability. The visualizations can use and interact with data stored on the browser side. Report authors can include extra data to be stored on the browser side when you create visualizations. Report consumers can filter visualizations directly on the report output using data that is already retrieved from the database. For more information, see Visualizations version 11.x in the online product documentation on www.ibm.com. 
Enhanced Map visualizations 
The Map visualization has been updated to allow adding multiple location categories to a map to reduce or eliminate ambiguous location names. A point location option is also available to show data for two location measures in two layers, one filled by regions, and one by points. Latitude and Longitude option is available with zoom and focus capabilities. 
Report consumers can interact with different map layers to customize how a map is displayed. Map clustering lets you group points on a map to help users better analyze data at different zoom levels. Also, you can visualize data by location using a heatmap layer on a map. For more information regarding enhanced mapping support, see the Adding custom points or regions to a map in the product documentation.

A section of the results appears as follows: 

You added a microchart to the crosstab for a quick overview of measure values for the filtered data items on Columns. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• From the Application bar, remove the New report without saving. 
• Leave IBM Cognos Analytics open for the next activity. 

Focus reports using filters 
Create filters to narrow the focus 
To narrow the focus of your report, you can create a filter expression in three different ways: 
• Custom based on data item - expression built by using the drag and drop method of adding data item(s) 
• Combined - combining two or more expressions 
• Advanced - custom filter based on an expression 
When you create a filter, you define conditions around query items to report on a specific subset of data. 
Use advanced detail filters 
A detail filter will be applied to all rows in the report. 
For detail filters, filter any item in the package that uses the Source tab, or filter items in the report that uses the Data Items tab or Queries tab. Use the Functions tab to create filter calculations. Use the Parameters tab to use existing filters. 
Apply a filter with aggregation 
Aggregated data can show totals, averages, or other formats of summarized data. 
Save time and effort by applying filters published with your source package rather than creating your own. 
Use summary filters 
To add a filter that will apply to groups in the report, click the Summary Filters tab in the Filters dialog box. 
When you use a summary filter, you can specify the group on which you want to filter. 
When you combine detail and summary filters, be aware that the detail filter will affect the summarized numbers that you are filtering on. Be sure to check that the results are as expected. 
Activity: Apply filters to a report 

Create a report that will be filtered on a specified data query item and a year query item.  
In this activity, you will accomplish the following: 
• Create the list. 
• Add a filter for Year. 
• Filter on Country. 
Create the list. 
• Ensure you are logged into IBM Cognos Analytics (http://localhost:9300/bi) as Frank Bretton (brettonf/Education1). 
• Create a new report that uses the Blank template, the Team content/Samples/Models/GO data warehouse (query) package, and a List data container. 
• Expand Sales and Marketing (query) > Sales (query). 
• Add the following query items to the list: 
• Employee by region: Country, City, First name, Last name, Position name 
• Sales fact: Revenue 
• Click the <Country> column body, Ctrl+click the <City> column body, and then from the on-demand toolbar, click Group / Ungroup. 
• Click the <Country> grouped column body, from the on-demand toolbar, click More, point to Headers & footers, and then click Create header. 
• With the <Country> column still selected, press the Delete key to remove the redundant column. 
• Click the <Revenue> list column body, from the on-demand toolbar, click Summarize, and then click Total. 
• Click the <Revenue> list column body, from the on-demand toolbar, click Sort, and then click Descending. 
• From the Application bar, run the report in HTML. 

The report is grouped on Country and City, with Country appearing as a header. The report is sorted in descending order by revenue so that representatives with the highest revenue appear first. Revenue is summarized by Total showing grouped summaries at the City and Country levels. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
Add a filter for Year. 
• Select the entire list data container. 
• From the on-demand toolbar, click Filters, and then click Edit Filters. 
The Filters - Query1 dialog box appears. There are two tabs: one for creating filters at the detail level, and one for creating filters at the summary level. 
• With the Detail Filters tab selected, click Add , click Advanced, and then click OK. 
• Under Available Components, ensure the Source tab  is selected at the bottom of the pane, navigate to Sales and Marketing (query) > Sales (query), and then expand Time. 

From the Time query subject, drag Year into the Expression Definition pane. 
The x appears as [Sales (query)].[Time].[Year]. You want to show data for the year 2012 only. 
• Click the end of the expression to place your cursor after [Year], and then type =2012. 
• Click Validate  to ensure the expression contains no errors. 
A section of the result appears as follows: 

The expression [Sales (query)].[Time].[Year]=2012 validated with no errors.  
There are different ways of creating filters to achieve the same result. For example you could achieve the same result using any of these methods: 
• Drag Year into the Expression Definition pane and then type =2012  
• create the expression [Sales (query)].[Time].[Date] between 2012-01-01 and 2012-12-31 
• create filters by adding operators and conditions to query items using SQL syntax 
• Click OK to close the Detail filter expression dialog box, and then click OK to close the Filters - Query1 dialog box. 
• Run the report in HTML. 
The report layout remains the same but the Revenue values are lower than before because the report only contains data for 2012 instead of all years. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
Filter on Country. 
You want the report to only include data for Austria and Italy. 
• Select the entire list data container, from the on-demand toolbar, click Filters, and then click Edit Filters. 
The Filters - Query 1 dialog box appears showing the detail filter you just created. You will create another detail filter. 
• Click Add, ensure that Country (the header) is selected under Custom based on data item, and then click OK. 
Advanced search options are also available. 
• Under the Find list, click Austria, and then Ctrl+click Italy. 
Below the Find list, a message appears indicating that two values have been selected. 
 
• Click OK to close the Filter condition dialog box, and then click OK to close the Filters - Query1 dialog box. 
Run the report in HTML. 

This report now only contains data for Austria and Italy for the year 2012. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• From the Switcher menu list, remove the current report without saving it. 
• Leave IBM Cognos Analytics open for the next activity. 
Activity: Apply a detail filter on fact data 

Create a report that displays total values in order to identify the top performing items. To create this report, add several filters and examine how they affect the query. 
In this activity, you will accomplish the following: 
• Create a list. 
• Apply a detail filter before auto aggregation. 
• Group and summarize the data. 
• Apply a detail filter after auto aggregation. 
• Examine the effects of the filters. 
Create a list. 
• Ensure you are logged into IBM Cognos Analytics as Frank Bretton (brettonf/Education1). 
• Create a new report that uses the Blank template, the 
Team content/Samples/Models/GO data warehouse (query) package, and a List data container. 
• Expand Sales and Marketing (query) > Sales (query). 
• Add the following query items to the list: 
• Products: Product line, Product type 
• Sales fact: Revenue 
• Click the Product line list column body, and then from the on-demand toolbar, click Group / Ungroup. 
• Click the Revenue list column body, from the on-demand toolbar, click Summarize, and then click Total. 
Run the report in HTML. 

The data is grouped and an aggregate row displays the total value generated for each Product type. Take note of one of the first grouped summarized totals, such as Cooking Gear, which is $272,835,984.18. You will compare this number with the values generated later. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• On the navigation menu, click Report > Queries > Query1. 
• In the Data Items pane, click Revenue, and then, from the Application bar, click Show properties. 
In the Properties pane, notice that the Detail property for Revenue is set to Automatic. 
• In the Data Items pane, click the Total(Revenue) query item. 
In the Properties pane, notice that the Summary property is set to Total. This is because, in the layout, you added an aggregate row displaying total revenue for grouped items in the report. 
• In the navigation menu, click Report > Queries, and then in the work area, click Query1. 
In the Properties pane, notice that the Auto group & summarize property for the query is set to Yes. You want to view each individual data record, so you will change this property to No. 

From the navigation menu, click Report > Queries > Query1 list, select Query1. 
• On the properties pane, click the Auto group & summarize property, and then select No from the list. 

The report now displays each individual record rather than a summary value for each Product type. 
Note: Do not click the Bottom navigation button because this report could return a large amount of data and it will take a considerable amount of time to render the last page. The order you see displayed in the results may vary because no sorting has been applied. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
Apply a detail filter before auto aggregation. 
You want this report to include only individual sales of product types that generated more than $100,000 in revenue. You will create a detail filter and apply it before auto aggregation. 
• From the navigation menu, click Report > Pages > Page1, and then select the List data container. 
You can verify that the list is selected by looking at the on-demand toolbar just above properties pane. 
• From the on-demand toolbar, click Filters, click Edit Filters, and then ensure the Detail Filters tab is selected in the Filters dialog box. 
• Click Add, from the Custom based on data item list select Revenue, and then click OK. 
• Ensure that the Operator is >, and then in the Value text box, type 100000 (100 thousand). 

• Click OK, and then in the Application area, click Before auto aggregation. 
• Click OK to close the Filters dialog box. 
• Run the report in HTML. 
The report now displays only data for individual sales of product types that generated more than $100,000 in revenue. 
• In the report, click Bottom. 
The total revenue generated by product type orders of over $100,000 is $496,713,003.20. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• From the navigation menu, click Report > Queries > Query1. 
The filter that you created appears in the Detail Filters pane. 
In the Detail Filters pane, click the Revenue>100000 filter. 
In the Properties pane, the properties specified for the filter display as follows: 
• Definition: displays the expression you created for this filter 
• Usage: is set to Required 
• Application: is set to Before Auto Aggregation 
Group and summarize the data. 
You want to see only one row of values for each item, so you will set the Auto Group & Summarize property for the query back to Yes. 
• On the navigation menu, click Report > Queries > Query1, and from the list, select Query1. 
• In the Properties pane, under DATA, change the Auto group & summarize property to Yes. 

There is only one row for each product type because the query will group and summarize the data at the lowest level of detail. 
The revenue generated by Cooking Gear is $1,863,445.82. When you ran this report without the filter, the revenue generated by Cooking Gear was 
$272,835,984.18. The value is different because it no longer includes individual orders that generated less than one hundred thousand dollars in revenue.  
The total revenue generated by all product lines is $496,713,003.20, which is the same as when you ran the report with the Auto group & summarize property for the query set to No. 
Since you specified that the filter was to be applied before the query will group and summarize retrieved data, the filter will exclude the same data regardless of whether the query retrieves data that is summarized or not summarized. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
Apply a detail filter after auto aggregation. 
You want the report to display only items for which the total value is greater than the indicated value. To achieve this, you will create a detail filter and apply it after auto aggregation. 
• On the navigation menu, click Report > Pages > Page1. 
• Select the List data container, from the on-demand toolbar click Filters, and then click Edit Filters. 
• Click Add, select Revenue from the Custom based on data item list, and then click OK. 
• Ensure that the Operator is >, and then in the Value text box, type 10000000 (10 million). 
• Click OK, and then ensure that under the Application section, After auto aggregation is selected. 
• Click OK to close the Filters dialog box. 
Examine the effects of the filters. 
• Run the report in HTML. 
Only the five product types that generated total revenue greater than ten million display in the report. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
You have decided to include items in the report even if the aggregated revenue generated is less than 10 million. However, in case you may want to use this filter in the future, you will disable this filter instead of deleting it. 
• Select the List data container. 
• From the on-demand toolbar, click Filters, and then click Edit Filters. 
• Click Revenue > 10000000, and then in the Usage area, click Disabled. 
• Click OK to close the Filters dialog box. 
Run the report in HTML. 

All product types that generated over $100,000 in revenue (in at least one order), again appear in the report, which indicates that the second filter you added has been disabled. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• On the navigation menu, click Report > Queries > Query1. 
Notice that the Revenue > 10000000 filter still appears in the query, though the icon beside it is grayed out, indicating that it is unavailable to the query. 
• In the Detail Filters pane, click the Revenue > 10000000 filter. 
In the Properties pane notice that, as specified, the Usage property for the filter is set to Disabled. 
• From the Switcher menu list, remove the current report without saving it. 
• Leave IBM Cognos Analytics open for the next activity. 
Activity: Apply a summary filter 

You will create a report that focuses on items that have generated values that are considered very successful. You will use a summary filter to focus on this data. 
In this activity, you will accomplish the following: 
• Apply a summary filter. 
• Navigate to the query explorer. 
Apply a summary filter. 
• Ensure you are logged into IBM Cognos Analytics as Frank Bretton (brettonf/Education1). 
• Create a new report that uses the Blank template, the Team content/Samples/Models/GO data warehouse (query) package, and a List data container. 
• Expand Sales and Marketing (query) > Sales (query).

• Close the rendered New report tab. 
Navigate to the query explorer. 
• From the navigation menu, click Report > Queries > Query1. 
The summary filter you added appears in the Summary Filters pane. 
• If the properties pane is not visible, click Show Properties. 
• In the Summary Filters pane, click the filter. 
In the Properties pane, the Scope property for this filter is set to Product line. 
• From the Switcher menu list, remove the current report without saving it. 
• Leave IBM Cognos Analytics open for the next activity. 
Focus reports using prompts 
Examine parameters and prompts 
Prompts ask the user to provide the value for the parameter that filters the report on specific data values. They function as dynamic filters. 
There are three ways to prompt for report specifications: 
• create a parameter for an item on the report 
• add a prompt page to the report containing one or more prompt items 
• add a prompt item to a report 
Parameters are placeholders that require a value to determine what data to report on. 
Parameterized filters consist of a query item and operator. The operator you choose determines some of the default properties of the prompt. For example, if you choose the = operator the user will only be able to select a single option from the prompt (MultiSelect - No). If you choose the ‘in’ operator, the user will be able to select multiple options from the prompt. 
Create a parameter for a report item 
Reporting can automatically generate prompted reports based on parameters you create. If you create a parameter for an item on a report, when you run the report you will be prompted to specify a value for that item. The report displays the information according to the value given in the prompt. The prompt is created automatically and must be answered in order to view the report. 
Add a prompt page 
You can create a prompt page to control how prompts appear in the report. A prompt page can be built by dragging prompt tools from the Tool box tab. 
You can also create a blank prompt page by adding a new page to the Prompt Pages section in Page Explorer. Once on the new prompt page, you can drag prompt items onto the work area. 
A date item will automatically generate a Calendar prompt, a number item generates a Text Box prompt, and a value item will generate a Value prompt. 
Add a prompt item to a report 
When a prompt item is dragged onto a report, a prompt wizard walks the report author through the prompt building process.  

The wizard will add a prompt control and a parameterized filter to the report by performing the following tasks: 
• Create a parameter. 
• Add a filter to the data container with the parameter. 
• Create a query for the prompt. 
• Add the query and the parameter to the prompt. 
If you add a prompt directly onto a report page, you will either need to set the prompt to automatically submit the selection, or add a Finish prompt button to the report so that the report will regenerate that uses the new criteria. 
Identify a prompt type 
Choose the appropriate prompt type for your reporting requirements. If you add prompt items to a report or prompt page, you can choose from the different types of prompts available in the Toolbox tab according to your needs. If you select items on a report and then create a prompt page, Reporting will choose an appropriate prompt type for you. 
Similarly, a generated prompt acts as a placeholder in the work area, but when the report is run, Reporting selects the appropriate prompt type for that report. 
If there are a large number of choices available (such as sales rep name), then Select & Search is a good option. This saves time in scrolling to look for the desired option. If the exact name or spelling of an item is unknown, then avoid using the Text Box prompt as the value must be typed in exactly as it appears in the report. 
Interval prompts are valuable for reporting on very specific time frames as they let you choose lowest to highest time intervals in days, hours, and minutes. 
Create a cascading prompt 
You can use values from a previous prompt to filter the values in the current prompt or picklist. 
The selection that the user makes in one prompt determines what is populated in another prompt. 
When you create a series of prompts that have a hierarchical relationship, you can define them as cascading, so that a prompt selection is determined by the choice of the user in the previous prompt. 
Activity: Add a parameter to create a prompt 

Create a report showing items by date to determine the values generated. Because the report contains detailed information, filter the report to show values after a specified time period. Create a parameter to prompt a user for a date and the report will return all dates greater than the one specified. 
In this activity, you will accomplish the following: 
• Create the list. 
• Add a date parameter. 
Create the list. 
• Open a new report that uses the Blank template, the Team content/Samples/ Models/GO data warehouse (query) package, and a List data container. 
• On the Sources tab, expand Sales and Marketing (query) > Sales (query). 
• Add the following query items to the list: 
• Sales order: Order number 
• Time: Date

Use calculations 
What are calculations? 
Calculations let you derive additional information from the data source. Create a layout calculation to add information to your report. Create calculated columns based on existing items in the model that uses query calculations. 
Calculations can be added to a list, crosstab, or chart report, as well as to the body, headers, and footers. Layout calculations can include run-time information such as current date, current time, and user name. 
Including calculated columns can help provide further insight into your data. You can create a query or layout calculation by inserting a calculation in to your report and then creating the expression in the Expression Editor. 
Create a calculated column to make a report more meaningful by deriving additional information from the data source. For example, you create an invoice report, and you want to see the total sale amount for each product ordered. Create a calculated column that multiplies the product price by the quantity ordered. 
If an expression is used in multiple reports, or used by different report authors, ask your modeler to create the expression as a standalone object in the model and include it in the relevant package. 
Add Date and Time functions 
Use date and time functions in calculations and filters to query on specific dates and times in your report. Date and Time functions can be used to build dates, modify existing dates or to filter the report for specific dates. 
A useful date/time function is the extract() function which returns an integer representing the value of datepart (year, month, day, hour, minute, second). 
Not all data sources support functions the same way. The data modeler can set a quality of service indicator (icon appearing beside some functions) on functions to give a visual clue about the behavior of the functions. Report authors can use the quality of service indicators to determine which functions to use in a report. 

Add string functions 
Use string functions in calculations and filters in your report to manipulate text data.. 
Some examples of string functions include: 
• substring(): A function to return part of a string 
• trim(): A function that removes specific characters from the beginning or end of a specific text data item 
• upper(): A function that changes the text returned to be in uppercase 
• lower(): A function that changes the text returned to be in lowercase 
String functions can be found under the Common Functions folder, or Vendor Specific Functions folder. For example, if a user entered ‘Golf Equipment ‘(with a space at the end) into the database, the report author would get unexpected results if they queried the database and was doing a comparison against ‘Golf Equipment’ (without a space at the end). This is a real world example where the trim() function should be used to remove trailing spaces before doing a comparison. 
Display prompt selections in report titles 
To display the selected prompt option in the report title, add a layout calculation to the report title that returns a different value depending on the prompt option a user selects. 
Activity: Add calculations to a report 

Create a report that will return values for a specified date. In addition to looking at actual values versus planned values, users want to see a percentage for how much of the planned values was met. The report should also display the date that the report is run.

• Ensure the List is selected, from the on-demand toolbar, click Filters > Edit Filters, and then click Add. 
• Click Advanced, and then OK. 
The Detail filter expression dialog box appears. 
• Create the following expression: 
[Date] between _first_of_month(2010-01-01) and _last_of_month (2010-03-31) 
Hint:  
• Drag Date from the Data items tab (the second tab at the bottom of the Available Components pane).  
• Drag _first_of_month and _last_of_month functions from the 
Business Date/Time Functions folder in the Functions  tab. 
Data items selected from the Source tab will be calculated and summarized after aggregation, whereas data items selected from the Data Items tab will be calculated and summarized before aggregation. 
This filter will return dates between January 1 2010 and March 31 2010 (First quarter of 2010). The _first_of_month() function returns the first day of the month in the date expression, while the _last_of_month() function returns the last day of the month in the date expression. You can use any date for the expression as long as it is in the proper format and it contains data. Make sure that there is a space between each function. 
• Click Validate (the check mark in the green box). 
• Click OK to close the Detail filter expression dialog box, and then click OK to close the Filters dialog box.

Customize reports with conditional formatting 
Conditional formatting can highlight exceptional data, and format areas of the report based on one or more string values, a report condition, or data values. Conditional formatting can help the report author create a single report that end users can customize, through prompts, to provide information specific to their needs. This lets the end user quickly and effectively isolate critical information necessary for timely business decisions. 
Three steps for conditional formatting 
There are three steps in creating conditional formatting in a report: 
• Create a variable 
• Assign the variable to a report object 
• Apply formatting to object based on conditional value 
Create a variable 
Create variables and values to decide what element of the report will determine the change and the possible outcomes. 
• Boolean variables are used if there are only two possible outcomes, where the values will be Yes or No. With this variable, you must define the condition. 
• String variables are used if there is more than one outcome, based on string values you will specify. 
• Language variables are used when the values are different languages. 
The string variable's condition does not need to test all possible cases of the language variable to hold all the possible languages. The expression will automatically create an Other category to identify all other values. 
The variable determines what will change in the report. For example, the report will vary depending on revenue, product line or the language in which the report is run. If you create a language variable, you do not need to define the condition, but you must choose the languages you want to support. 
Assign the variable to a report object 
Start by selecting a reporting object in the report layout that you want to add conditional formatting to, such as a column, column header, or report title. This step is performed in Conditional explorer. 
After you have created your variable, you must define how the report will appear for each value. To do this, select the text or part of the report that will vary, and then apply the variable to it using the Properties pane. 
• Conditional Styles: Add conditional styles to highlight data in you report, based on set ranges. 
• Style Variable: Specifies a variable based on which the object can be conditionally styled. 
• Text Source Variable: Specifies a variable based on which the text can be chosen. 
• Render Variable: Specifies a variable based on which the object can be conditionally rendered. 
When you apply the variable, the values for which you can perform conditional report authoring appear. By default, Reporting selects all the values assuming you will format all of them. If you wish to create conditional formatting for only some values, you can deselect the others. 
If you apply a language variable, an additional value called Other appears by default. 
When you create a string or report language variable, and create or choose variables for it, an additional value called Other also appears by default. 
Format based on conditional value 
Once the report element has been designated as conditional, set the display for that value by modifying the report to appear the way you want it to look if that condition is satisfied. 
This step is performed in Conditional explorer. 
This step does not apply when working with a Render Variable. 
When you select a value in the Condition explorer, the A green outlined message appears stating the variable is set to undefined. This means that conditional formatting is turned on and that all changes you make to the report only apply to the variable you selected. 
After you have set the display for each value, turn the conditional formatting off by double-clicking (No variable) from the Condition explorer. 
Conditionally render report objects 
If objects are not rendered, they do not take up space in the report when it is run. 
Conditional rendering is useful when your report contains sensitive data or data that may be relevant for some users but not for others. 
When conditional rendering is applied to a column in a list report, the conditional rendering applies to all portions of the column including the title, the body cells, and header and footer cells. 
A report can contain explicit data for some users and exclude that data for others. 
You can also conditionally format one crosstab fact based on another crosstab fact that uses the Conditional Styles dialog box. This allows a fact column to be highlighted based upon the value found in another fact column. 
You can conditionally format one crosstab measure based on another crosstab measure that uses the Conditional Styles dialog box. 

Activity: Create a multilingual report 

Examine the values for all products to promote those that are the most profitable. This report will be distributed to offices in different countries and will be run in different languages. 
In this activity, you will accomplish the following: 
• Create a basic list report. 
• Create a language variable. 
• Define the title as conditional text. 
• Set the display for each value. 
• Run the report in various languages. 
Create a basic list report. 
• Ensure you are logged into IBM Cognos Analytics (http://localhost:9300/bi) as Frank Bretton (brettonf/Education1). 
• Create a new report that uses the 1 column template, the Team content/Samples/Models/GO data warehouse (query) package, and a List data container. 
• Under Insertable objects, on the Sources tab, expand Sales and Marketing (query) > Sales (query). 
• Add the following query items to the list: 
• Products: Product line, Product type 
• Sales fact: Revenue 
• Group the <Product line> column, and then summarize the <Revenue> column by Total. 
• Save the report in My content as Basic Report. 
• Run the report in HTML to examine the report. 
A simple list report appears showing totals for each product line. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
Create a language variable. 
Apply conditional formatting to allow the header text to appear in the report run language. 
• From the navigation menu, click Report > Variables , and then drag Report Language Variable to the Variables pane. 
The Languages dialog box appears. 
• Scroll through the list to locate and select the check boxes beside all of the English, French, and German languages (there are multiples for each language), and then click OK. 
All of the languages you selected appear in the Values pane. 
• In the Values pane, click English, Shift-click English (Zimbabwe), and then underneath the Values list, click Group Values . 
• Repeat the previous step to group all French languages together. 
• Repeat the previous step to group all German languages together. 
There are seventeen English languages, six French, and six German. You selected all of these languages and grouped them together. That way you only have to format the report for three grouped values, rather than for each individual language. 
The report now has one variable with three grouped values, one for each language in which the report will be run. Because you created a language variable, the expression is created for you. 
• On the Application bar, click Show properties. 
• In the Properties pane, under MISCELLANEOUS, in the Name box, replace Report Language1 with Language, and then press Enter. 
• From the navigation menu, click Report > Pages > Page1. 
Define the title as conditional text. 
• Double-click the Text field at the top of the report, in the Text dialog box, type Product Report Title, and then click OK. 
• Select the header block containing the report title, and then from the on-demand toolbar, click Horizontal alignment, and then left justify the header text. 
• Click the Text item in the header to select it. 
• From the on-demand tool bar, click Font, and then change the font Size to 16pt. and the Weight to Bold. 
• In the Properties pane, under CONDITIONAL, double-click Text source variable. 
The Text source variable dialog box appears. 
• From the Variable list, select Language. 
The Values pane shows the languages you chose, plus an option called Other. The languages are selected by default so that you can use the Conditional state icon to perform conditional authoring for any of these languages. 
• Click OK. 
Set the display for each value. 
• From the Application bar, click the Conditional state icon , and then click English. 
• Change the title text to Product Report. 
• Click the Conditional state icon , and then click French. 
• Change the title text to Rapport sur les produits. 
• Click the Conditional state icon again, and change the Language to German. 
• Change the title text to Produktbericht. 
• Click Conditional state and then click Clear Conditional state. 
This turns off conditional formatting. 
In order to run a report in different languages, the data source must be multilingual. Your browser must also be able to support multilingual characters, or else the characters will appear as boxes. 
Now you can run the report in various languages. 
Run the report in various languages. 
• Run the report in HTML. 
Your report appears in the system language as this is your current default language. The report title appears as you created it for the first variable, if the first language selected matches the system language. You will now run the report in the other languages to see the results. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• Click Run options, and then click Show run options. 
You want to choose a language other than your current default. 
• Under Language, scroll down to and select French (France), and then click OK. 
• Run the report in HTML. 
The report appears in French, including the conditional title you created. 

IBM Cognos Analytics cannot translate the data returned by the query. This must be done as part of data modeling and must be included in the published package. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 

Repeat the previous steps to run the report in German (Austria). 

Notice that the order of products is different because the default sorting of the Product lines and Product types is now sorting differently rendered names.  
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• Repeat the previous steps to run the report in English (Zimbabwe). 
Again, notice that the default sorting causes the report names to appear in a different order because they are translated differently. For example, what appears as Accessoires personnels in French, now appears as Personal Accessories in English. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• Click Run options, and then click Show run options. 
• Under Language, scroll up, select (Default), and then click OK. 
• From the Switcher menu list, remove the current report without saving it. 
• Leave IBM Cognos Analytics open for the next activity. 
Activity: Highlight exceptional data and 
conditionally render a column 

Create a report that displays fact data in different colors depending on value to quickly identify high and low values. Include a conditionally optional description column. 
In this activity, you will accomplish the following: 
• Create a list. 
• Create the conditional variables. 
• Define the measure as conditional. 
• Add a Boolean variable. 
• Run the report. 
Create a list. 
• Ensure you are logged into IBM Cognos Analytics (http://localhost:9300/bi) as Frank Bretton (brettonf/Education1). 
• Create a new report that uses the Blank template, 
Team content/Samples/Models/GO data warehouse (query) package, and a List data container. 
• From the Application bar, ensure that Automatic group and summary behavior for lists is cleared under Manage  > Options > Report. 
• Expand Sales and Marketing (query) > Sales (query). 
• Add the following query items to the list: 
• Products: Product line, Product type, Product description 
• Retailers: Region 
• Time: Year  
• Sales fact: Revenue. 
Group the <Product line> column and then summarize the <Revenue> column by Total. 

Your report will contain several columns, including one measure (in this example, Revenue). The Product description column will be the query item that will be visible or hidden depending on the end user's choice of output, and the Revenue column will highlight exceptionally high and low values. 
Create the conditional variables. 
Create a variable to define revenue as high if it is greater than 1 million, or low if it is less than 500,000. 
• From the navigation menu, click Report > Variables . 
• From the Toolbox, drag a String Variable to the Variables pane. 
Because you are creating a string variable, you must specify the condition on which the measure value will change, and then create values for the possible outcomes. 
• Create and validate the following expression that will set a variable identifying high and low values based on your data: 
if ([Query1].[Revenue]>1000000) then ('high') else if 
([Query1].[Revenue]<500000) then ('low') 
Hint: You can double-click Revenue in the Available Components pane to add it to the expression as you write it. 
• Click OK. 
• Below the Values pane, click Add . 
• In the Add dialog box, type high, and then click OK. 

Click Add again, type low, and then click OK. 
The values created in previous steps must be spelled exactly as they are spelled in the expression definition for the variable. 
• If the properties pane is not visible, then from the Application bar, click Show properties. 
• With the String1 variable still selected, in the properties pane, under 
MISCELLANEOUS, in the Name box, change the name to Revenue_high_low, and then press Enter. 
• Navigate to Page1. 
Now that you have created a variable and specified its values, you will format the measure cells for each value. 
Define the measure as conditional. 
• Click the <Revenue> list column body, and then from the properties pane, under CONDITIONAL, double-click Style variable. 
The Style variable dialog box appears. 
• From the Variable list, select the Revenue_high_low variable, and then click OK. 
The measure cells are now conditionally formatted using the variable you just created. You will now set the display for each value. 
• From the Application bar, click Conditional state , and then click high. 
• Ensure that the <Revenue> list column body is still selected, and then from the ondemand toolbar, click Font. 
• Set Foreground color to Green, set Weight to Bold, and then click OK to close the Font dialog box. 
• Click Conditional state, and then click low. 
• Ensure that the <Revenue> list column body is still selected, from the on-demand toolbar, click Font. 
• Set Foreground color to Red, set Weight to Bold, and then click OK to close the Font dialog box. 
• Click Conditional state, and then click Clear conditional state to turn the conditional formatting off. 
Run the report in HTML. 
The report runs and the conditional formatting has identified exceptionally high values with green font, and exceptionally low values with red font. 
• Click Page down several times to see additional identified critical values. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
Add a Boolean variable. 
A Boolean variable creates a yes or no condition. You will use a Boolean variable to conditionally format the report so that the Product description column only appears if the report is rendered in HTML. 
• Navigate to Page 1, and then click the <Product description> list column body. 
• From the on-demand toolbar, click Select Ancestor , and then click List column at the bottom of the list. 
• In the Properties pane, under CONDITIONAL, double-click the Render variable property. 
The Render variable dialog box appears. 
• From the Variable list, select New boolean variable. 
• In the New variable dialog box, in the Name field, type vProduct_description, and then click OK. 
The Report expression dialog box appears. 
• Create and validate the following expression that sets the report output to HTML: 
ReportOutput ()='HTML' 
Hint: Under Available Components, click the Functions tab, expand Report Functions, and then double-click ReportOutput to add it to the expression. 
• Click OK until all dialog boxes are closed. 
You can now run the report in different formats to test the output. 
Run the report. 

The report includes the Product description column. 
• Click the down arrow to the right of the Run button, and then click Run PDF. 

When the report is rendered in PDF format, the optional column is not rendered. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• From the Switcher menu list, remove the current report without saving it. 
• Leave IBM Cognos Analytics open for the next activity. 

Drill-through definitions 
Navigate to related data 
Drill-through access lets users navigate between reports to view related data to help them answer business questions. 
In IBM Cognos Analytics, using a packaged based drill-through definition, report authors can set up drill-through access to and from reports, queries, advanced queries, and analyses that uses dimensional and relational data sources. 
It is also possible to set up drill-through access to IBM Cognos Analytics targets from third party sources and to third party targets from Cognos sources. Setting up drillthrough access to and from third-party sources and targets can be accomplished that uses URL requests or by using the Software Development Kit. 

Enhance report layout 
View the structure of the report 
To view your report in a different way and see how objects are organized, view the page structure. 
View the page structure to: 
• view the entire contents of a report page in a tree structure 
• move objects quickly from one area of a page to another 
• modify the object properties 
• view a complex layout 
Viewing the page as a tree structure can be useful for locating the objects in a page and troubleshooting problems with nested objects. 
A complex layout may make it difficult to select, cut, and paste objects in the layout view. Objects are easier to locate in the page structure view. This view can also be helpful if you want to modify an object but are not sure where the object is located within the report structure. Once you know where an object it placed, you can select it and modify its properties.  
Objects can be changed in either view, depending on your preference. 
Use Guided report layout 
Guided report layout helps you create a report more quickly and dynamically by simplifying the process of adding objects to the canvas. 

The above illustration shows Guided report layout functions during the dropping of a measure onto the report canvas. Notice that the shaded 12345 area is a visual indicator to the user that the value being dropped onto the canvas is a measure. It also indicates exactly where that value will be located on the canvas if the user drops it at that instant. 
Some of the key features included with Guided report layout include: 
• Visual indicators show where an object is going to be placed before you drop it on to the canvas. 
• When you drag a measure on to the canvas, you get a summarized text item with a descriptive label and formatting. 
• When you drag a column that is not a measure on to the canvas, you get a list with a descriptive title. 
• You can place objects on the left, center, right, top, or bottom of a container with one gesture. 
• Tables use percentage sizing which ensures that different screen resolutions are supported. 
• You can resize an object by dragging one of its grippers. 
Guided report layout is enabled by default. You can disable it by accessing Manage > Options > Report. 
Guided report layout does not work with active reports. 
Force page breaks 
To force page breaks based on a data item, you must associate the page set with a query and then define a grouping structure for the page set. 
You can add multiple detail pages to a page set. 
You can also create nested page sets, and can define a master-detail relationship between them to see data in the nested page set that is related to the data in the parent page set. For example, you have a page set that shows pages of product line information. The page set contains a nested page set that shows pages of product type information. 
You can use a page set to create a report that contains detail pages displaying data for each order method. Each order method type will begin on a new page. 
A page break can also be created at the same time as a report section is created. 
Create horizontal pagination 
Horizontal pagination enables you to span wide reports across multiple PDF pages with the appropriate page number. 
You can only use horizontal pagination with list and crosstab reports. 
There are three options for adding horizontal page numbers: 
• Preset (that uses Number Style) 
• Custom Number Style 
• Report Layout Functions 
Modify the report structure 
By unlocking the cells, you can add multiple items to a single column to tailor a report to your needs. 
Unlock cells to manipulate an object’s contents. Once they are unlocked, you can change the text and add objects inside existing objects. This feature is useful for displaying related information in a single column, or for renaming a column. You can add additional rows to a list report to add extra information. You can add additional rows to a list report that uses the Structure menu. 
Once a new row is added you can merge the cells by selecting one or more cells and then click the Merge cells button. 
Format objects across a report 
Format reports quickly and consistently using Cascading Style Sheet (CCS) classes. CSS classes are used in reports and templates. 
To determine what class an object uses, select the object and view the Classes property. An object also inherits the classes set for its parent objects.

Use additional report-building techniques 
Enhance a report design 
When information runs in horizontal bands, use a block to hold the objects. 
Reports may have headers and footers. Determine what objects to use when building a report based on the kind of information you want to display and how you want it to appear. If information applies to the entire report and you want it to appear on every page, place it in the header or footer. 
When information runs vertically, such as text beside an image, use a table to organize the objects. 
Properties applied to an object will also be applied to any child items. It is best to set styling properties at the highest level to save time and effort. For example, if you set the font type for a list object then all items in the list or added to the list will inherit the same font. Property Inheritance is the passing of parent attributes to child items. Use the Select Ancestor button on the Properties pane title bar to help determine the level at which to apply settings. 
Avoid fixed size objects because they are rigid and may not work with your overall design. 
An empty block does not add space between objects. The block must contain an object, or you must specify the padding of the block to use the block for spacing. 
If objects have borders, use margins to make the objects look spaced apart. 
Add objects to reports 
You can format items and objects to change their size, shape, location, and behavior according to your needs. 
You can use text items to communicate relevant information about the report to its users. 
You can add a background image to a data frame object like a list or crosstab, a cell in a table, or to the entire page. It is important to be aware that a background image can obscure the data in the report to some degree. 
You can use tables to assist with the spatial layout of report types and layout objects. Tables can control where objects are placed. Unlike some graphics software, Cognos Analytics - Reporting will not let you place objects anywhere on the work area. 
Convert a list to a crosstab 
When you convert a list to a crosstab, the list columns you select become columns and nested columns in the crosstab, and the unselected columns become rows and nested rows. If you have one measure, it becomes the cells of the crosstab. If you have more than one measure, then the measures will appear as columns. 
Explore reuse 
Report authors can customize any object in one location and save the customized style for reuse in other reports. You can create and reuse styles for almost any object, other than a visualization. For example, create a style for a header, save it, and then apply it to other headers in your report. 
To reuse a style, you define a style for one object, save it, and then apply the style to another object of the same type. For more information, see Reusing a style from another object in the product documentation. 
If you reuse an object that contains other objects, you can replace the child objects with a different object to customize your report. To change the contents of a reused object, you must override the child object that uses the Properties pane. 
Instead of creating new layout components (such as page headers) for each report, you can create an object in one report and then reuse it in different reports. Reusing layout components saves you time and lets you apply standard company formatting to multiple reports. 
By default, reused objects are automatically updated each time the report is run. This means that when you open or run a report containing a reused object, if the object has been changed in the source report, this change will automatically be applied in your report. 
If you want a reused object to be updated manually instead of automatically, in the report where the object is reused, select the object, and then in the Properties pane, change the Embed property from Reference to Copy. 
When you reuse a layout object in a different report, you can override child objects within this object (such as a text item in a page header object) if the child objects have been named in the source report. 
Shared objects are stored in the layout component cache. The cache contains the definitions of the shared objects. When you open a report that contains layout component reference objects, the report(s) containing the shared layout objects is opened and the definitions are copied into the Reporting cache. Object names cannot contain white space and must begin with a letter. When you override child objects, you can replace the child object with any other object, not just an object of the same type. 
For example, if the child object is a text item, you can replace it with an image. 
Activity: Section a report and reuse objects 

Create a sectioned list report and add some descriptive information to it. The report must include a title on each page describing the contents of the report, and information about whom to contact if users have any questions. 
In this activity, you will accomplish the following: 
• Create the list report. 
• Section the list and convert it to a crosstab. 
• Create a page header and footer. 
• Create a unique header style. 
• Specify unique object names. 
• Reuse the header block. 
Create the list report. 
• Ensure you are logged into IBM Cognos Analytics (localhost:9300/bi) as Frank Bretton (brettonf/Education1). 
• Create a new report that uses the Blank template, 
Team content/Samples/Models/GO data warehouse (query) package, and a List data container. 
• Expand Sales and Marketing (query) > Sales (query). 
• Add the following query items to the list: 
• Employee by region: Country 
• Products: Product line 
• Time: Year 
• Sales fact: Revenue 
• Summarize <Revenue> by Total. 
• Run the report in HTML. 
A simple list report appears. The report runs as expected. There is one Overall - Total at the very bottom of the report. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
Section the list and convert it to a crosstab. 
• Click the <Country> list column body, from the on-demand toolbar, click Section / unsection, and then click Section / unsection from the list. 
• Run the report in HTML. 
The report is sectioned so that separate lists appear for each country. However, it can be difficult to interpret. There is still only one total at the very bottom of the report, even though the data is sectioned by Country. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• Click the <Year> list column body, from the on-demand toolbar, click More, and then click Pivot List to Crosstab from the list. (Hint: You may want to close the properties pane so you can view the More icon.) 
• Run the report in HTML. 

Because you selected Year before you converted the list into a crosstab, years now appears as columns. Product line appears on rows, and Revenue, because it can be aggregated, appears as measures on the report. You can now interpret the data more quickly. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
Create a page header and footer. 
• Click to the right of the crosstab data container. 
• From the on-demand toolbar, click More, point to Headers & footers, and then click Page header & footer. 
The Page header & footer dialog box appears. 
• Select the Header and Footer check boxes, and then click OK. 
• In the Header, click Add, and then click Block. 
• From the Toolbox, drag a Text item into the Block object in the Page header. 
• In the Text dialog box, type Product Line Sales by Year, and then click OK. 
Create a unique header style. 
You will format the objects that you added to the header. 
• With the header text still selected, from the on-demand toolbar, click Font. 
• Change the font to Arial, 16pt, Bold, and then a Foreground color of White. 
• Click OK to close all open dialog boxes. 
• Select the entire header block, from the on-demand toolbar, click the down arrow next to Background color, and then from the Basic colors tab, click Teal. 
The report contains a header with the title that you specified. It has been formatted according to the properties you have set. 
You now want to reuse the objects that you created and formatted to avoid repeating steps in building the footer. 
Specify unique object names. 
• On the Application bar, click Show properties. 
• Ensure the header block is selected, in the Properties pane, under MISCELLANEOUS, in the Name property, type Title Block, and then press Enter. 
• Click the header Text item, in the Properties pane, under MISCELLANEOUS, in the Name property, type Title Text, and then press Enter. 
If you try to assign a name that is not unique, Reporting displays a warning message informing you that the name must be unique. 
If you select an element of the report, such as a column in a list, and want to deselect it, press the Esc key on your keyboard. 
Reuse the header block. 
• From the Toolbox, expand the ADVANCED section, and then drag a Layout component reference object into the footer. 
The Component reference dialog box appears. 
To reuse an object in the footer, you need to specify the object to be referenced. You can choose from the two objects to which you have previously assigned names, as well as the list containing the crosstab. In this case, you will select the block object because it also contains the text item object. 
• Under Available components to reference, click Title Block, and then click OK. 

The footer now contains the same object and formatting as the header. 
• Click the text in the footer. 
In the Properties pane, you can only select the layout component reference object and not the block or text item objects individually. This is because it is referencing the block object in the header. Remember, the block object in the header also contains the text item object. 
You want to change the text in the footer to contain contact information. 
• In the Properties pane, click Overrides, and then click the ellipsis. 
• In the Overrides dialog box, select the Title Text check box, and then click OK. 
The layout component reference object in the footer no longer contains text. Only the referenced block object remains. 
• Drag a Text item object into the component override area of the footer block, type Please contact the Sales Manager for more details, and then click OK. 
• Click the Text item object in the footer, and then change the font to Arial 12pt, Bold, and Foreground color of White. 

Click OK to close the Foreground Color dialog box, and then click OK to close the Font dialog box. 
• Run the report in HTML, and then scroll to the bottom of the page to view the footer. 

Both the header and footer contain a teal block with white font. 
This is a simplified example of reusing report objects. This technique might be best for reusing an object with numerous format properties applied. 
You can also reuse objects between different reports. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
• From the Switcher menu list, remove the current report without saving it. 
• Leave IBM Cognos Analytics open for the next activity. 
Activity: Reuse layout components in a different report 

To save time when creating new reports, create one report containing a standard page header that can be used in many reports, and then, create one report that will reuse this page header. 
In this activity, you will accomplish the following: 
• Create a header to be reused in other reports. 
• Add additional details to the header. 
• Reuse the standard page header. 
• Add data and format the report. 
• Modify the shared page header. 
• Manually update the shared page header. 
Create a header to be reused in other reports. 
• Ensure you are logged into IBM Cognos Analytics (http://localhost:9300/bi) as Frank Bretton (brettonf/Education1). 
• Create a new report that uses the Blank template, and the 
Team content/Samples/Models/GO data warehouse (query) package. 
• In the work area, click Add, and then click Table 
• Create a table with 3 columns and 1 row. 
Because you want to reuse this table as a page header in other reports, you will name the table object. 
• Click the Container selector in the upper left cell, to select the entire table. 
• On the Application bar, click Show properties if necessary to display the properties. 
• In the properties pane, under MISCELLANEOUS, in the Name property, type StandardPageHeader, and then press Enter. 
You want to add your company logo to the left side of the page header. 
• Under Insertable objects, click Toolbox, expand LAYOUT, and then drag an Image object to the left cell of the table. 
• With the image selected, in the Properties pane, under URL SOURCE, doubleclick the URL property. 
In the Image Picker dialog box, beside the Browse button, delete the existing path, type http://localhost:88/images/go_logo_small.jpg, and then click OK. 
If the OK button does not become active, try clearing the URL path and re-entering the http address. 
A graphic now appears in the first table cell. 
You want to add a text item in the middle of the page header that can be used to add a report title. 
• From the Toolbox tab, drag a Text item to the center cell of the table, and then click OK to close the Text dialog box without adding any text. 
You will not specify the text to be used yet, because this will be different for each report. You will name this text object so that it can be overridden when the page header is reused in other reports. 
• With the new Text item selected, in the Properties pane, under 
MISCELLANEOUS, for the Name property type ReportTitle, and then press Enter. 
Add details to the header. 
You want to add date and time information to the report header. 
• In the right table cell, click Add, and then click Table. 
• Set Number of columns to 1, Number of rows to 2, and then click OK. 
• From the Toolbox, from the TEXTUAL section, drag a Layout calculation object to the top cell of the table you added in the previous step. 
• In the Report expression dialog box, click the Functions  tab, expand Report Functions, and then drag AsOfDate to the Expression Definition pane. 
• Validate the expression, and then click OK to close the Report expression dialog box. 
You want to add a time stamp, to appear in the bottom-right corner of the page header. 
• From the Toolbox, drag a second Layout calculation object to the bottom cell of the table you added previously. 
• Click the Functions tab, expand Report Functions, and then drag AsOfTime to the Expression Definition pane. 
• Validate the expression, and then click OK to close the Report expression dialog box. 

On the Application bar, click Save. 
• Navigate to My content, in the Save as box type Layout Library, and then click Save. 
• From the Switcher menu list, leave the current report open, and click the 
Welcome page  to return to it. 
Reuse the standard page header. 
• Create a new report that uses the Blank template, the Team content/Samples/Models/GO data warehouse (query) package, and a List data container. 
• Under Insertable objects, click the Toolbox, and then  drag a Block above the list header area. 

• From Toolbox/ADVANCED section, drag a Layout component reference object to the Block. 
• In the Component reference dialog box, select the Another report radio button, click the ellipsis, and then navigate to My content. 
• Click Layout Library, and then click Open. 
• Under Available components to reference, click StandardPageHeader, and then click OK. 
The page header from the Layout Library report appears. You will customize the report. 
• In the header, click the Layout Component Reference object. 
• From the Application bar, click Show properties. 
• In the Properties pane, under GENERAL, double-click the Overrides property. 
The Overrides dialog box appears. Because you gave the report title text object a distinct name, you can now override its contents in the shared page header. 
Select the ReportTitle check box, and then click OK. 
• From the Toolbox, drag a Text item to the component override area of the center cell of the header. 
• In the Text dialog box, Quantity by Order Method, and then click OK. 
• With the Text item still selected, from the on-demand toolbar, change the font to Arial, and the size to 22 pt. 

Add data and format the report. 
• Select the list, to put it in focus. 
• From the Sources tab, expand the Sales and Marketing (query) folder, and then expand the Sales (query) namespace. 
• Add the following query items to the list: 
• Order method: Order method type 
• Sales fact: Quantity 
• Save the report to the My content folder as Quantity by Order Method. 
Run the report in HTML. 

The header you created in the Layout Library report displays the title that you added to this report. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 
Modify the shared page header. 
• In the Page header of the list report, click the Layout component reference object (the entire block). 
In the Properties pane, the Embed property is set to Reference. This means any changes made to the shared page header in the Layout Library source report will be automatically applied in this report. You will now modify the shared page header in the source report. 
• On the Application bar, expand the Switcher menu list. 
• Click the Layout Library report to open it. 
• In the Page header, click <%AsOfTime()%>, and then press Delete. 
• On the Application bar, click Save. 
• Expand the Switcher menu list. 
• Click the Quantity by Order Method report to open it, and then run the report in HTML. 
The change that you made to the page header in the source report has automatically been applied to this shared page header, as seen in the top right corner. The AsOfTime is no longer there. 
• Close the rendered New report tab. 

Manually update the shared page header. 
You decide you do not want changes to the page header in this report to be applied automatically when the header changes in the source (Layout Library) report. 
• In the current Quantity by Order Method report, in the page header, click the Layout component reference object. 
• In the Properties pane, under GENERAL, change the Embed property to Copy. 
• Save the report. 
To ensure that the changes you make to the reports are applied properly, you will close and reopen the reports. 
• Remove the Layout Library report from the Switcher menu list. 
• On the Applications bar, click the Edit button to take the report out of edit mode. 
• From the Side bar, click My content, and then beside the Layout Library report, click More, and then click Edit report. 
The Page header appears as follows: 
 
• In the left cell of the Page header, drag the Image object to the right of the center cell that contains the Text item so that they switch places. 
 
• Save the report. 
Remove the Quantity by Order Method report from the Switcher menu list, and then open it from My content on the Welcome page. 

Although you switched the order of the image and text objects in the source report, this change is not reflected in the page header in this report because you changed the Embed property to Copy. To make the page header in the target report consistent with the standard page header you created in the Layout Library report, you will now manually update the shared page header. 
• Ensure the report is in Edit mode. (Hint: The Insertable objects are either visible or its tab  appears in the side bar.) If it is not in Edit mode, then on the 
Applications bar, click Edit . 
• In the Page header, click the Layout component reference object, from the ondemand toolbar click More, and then Update Component Copy. 

The header is updated to reflect the changes made in the Layout Library source report, with the title on the left and the graphic in the middle. 
• Save the report. 
• Remove all reports from the Switcher menu list. 
• Leave IBM Cognos Analytics open for the next activity. 
Activity: Explore reports that contain no data
